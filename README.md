# Quote

A random quote generator. This is made as an assignment for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) in JavaScript. It features [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons and AJAX.

## How does it work?

An AJAX request to the [Forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) gets the data, which gets displayed, and then it is possible to post it to Twitter.  
**NOTE:** Use http instead of https.

Live example on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/leohajder/full/vXNQgx).
